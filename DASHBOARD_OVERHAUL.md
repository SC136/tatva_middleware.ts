## 💡 Key Improvements

### **1. Dynamic Calculations**
```typescript
// Everything is calculated from real data
const totalIncome = filteredTransactions
  .filter(t => t.type === 'income')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);

// Growth compared to previous period
const incomeGrowth = ((totalIncome - previousIncome) / previousIncome) * 100;

// Profit margin percentage
const profitMargin = (netProfit / totalIncome) * 100;
```

### **2. Smart Period Filtering**
Automatically filters data based on selected time range:
- Uses `date-fns` for accurate date calculations
- Compares with previous period for growth metrics
- Updates all sections simultaneously

### **3. Empty States**
Friendly messages when no data exists:
- "No transactions yet" with CTA to add first transaction
- "All products well stocked" celebration message
- Icons and helpful text guide users

### **4. Visual Hierarchy**
- Gradient cards for key metrics (easy scanning)
- Color-coded transactions (green=income, red=expense)
- Warning styling for low stock (orange alerts)
- Consistent iconography
